    "# Federated learning: how to encapsulate a custom model in Sherpa.FL\n",
    "\n",
    "The present notebook tackles the problem encapsulating a custom machine learning model into *Sherpa.FL* for experimentation in the federated configuration. \n",
    "In this case, we will create a learning model from scratch and show how to make it interact with the *Sherpa.FL* framework. \n",
    "For simplicity, a two-features case of linear regression is considered, since explicit formula for the minimization of the object function is available (see [Introduction to statistical learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) Section 3.1).\n",
    "For completeness, we assess the *accuracy* in a federated learning context, and we address the *privacy level needed* in terms of sampling the sensitivity of our model for application of Differential Privacy. \n",
    "For a more extensive use of differential privacy with Federated Learning, see also notebooks on [Linear Regression](./federated_models_linear_regression.ipynb) and [K-means clustering](./federated_models_clustering_k_means.ipynb).\n",
    "Also, see the notebook on [Regression using Keras](./federated_models_regression_deeplearning.ipynb), where a neural network model is used to perform regression. \n",

    "1. How to load the data;\n",
    "2. The model.\n",

    "**How to load the data**\\\n",
    "A method that returns train, test and validation data need to be provided, wrapping it in the class `data_base`.\n",
    "Typically, existing data is used. \n",

That is, instead of computing analytically the *global* sensitivity $\\Delta f$, we compute an *empirical estimation* of it by sampling over the dataset.\n",
