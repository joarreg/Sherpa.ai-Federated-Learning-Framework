    "The basic idea of differential privacy is to make a particular query stochastic so that the underlying data is kept private. The average attack consists of performing the same query many times in order to reliably estimate the underlying data. This is, of course, not desirable so we should either limit the number of queries or design algorithms that are not vulnerable under this kind of attack.\n",

    "A possible solution to this problem (e.g. see [RAPPOR technology](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42852.pdf) and [Jiang 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025518310429)) is to create a node that contains two pieces of information: the true data and a **permanent randomized response** (PRR). The latter is initialized to None and, once the node receives the first query, it creates a random binary number following the algorithm described above which is saved as the PRR. The result of the query is then a randomized response using the PRR as input. This way, even if the query is performed a large number of times, the attacker may only guess with certainty the PRR, but not the true data."
