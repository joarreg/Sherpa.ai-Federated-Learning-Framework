# Sherpa.ai Federated Learning Framework

[Sherpa.ai](http://sherpa.ai) Federated Learning Framework has been developed to facilitate open research in the ﬁeld, with the objective of building models that learn from decentralized data, preserving data privacy. It is an open-source platform and aims at supporting 100 percent of the AI algorithms used in industry.

Sherpa.ai Federated Learning Framework is an open-source framework for Machine Learning that is dedicated to data privacy protection. It has been developed to facilitate open research and experimentation in Federated Learning, a machine learning paradigm aimed at learning models from decentralized data (e.g., data located on users’ smartphones) and ensuring data privacy. This is achieved by training the model locally in each node (e.g., on each smartphone), sharing the model-updated parameters (not the data) and securely aggregating the updated parameters to build a better model. This technology could be disruptive in cases where it is compulsory to ensure data privacy, as in the following examples:

*    When data contains sensitive information, such as email accounts, personalized recommendations, and health information, applications should employ data privacy mechanisms to learn from a population of users whilst the sensitive data remains on each user’s device.

*    When data is located in data silos, an automotive parts manufacturer, for example, may be reluctant to disclose their data, but would benefit from models that learn from each other's data, in order to improve production and supply chain management.

*    Due to data-privacy legislation, banks and telecom companies, for example, cannot share individual records, but would benefit from models that learn from data across several entities.

Sherpa.ai is focused on democratizing Federated Learning by providing methodologies, pipelines, and evaluation techniques specifically designed for Federated Learning. The Sherpa.ai Federated Learning Platform enables developers to simulate Federated Learning scenarios with models, algorithms, and data provided by the framework, as well as their own data.

Sherpa.ai Federated Learning Framework is a project of [Sherpa.ai](http://sherpa.ai) in collaboration with the [Andalusian Research Institute in Data Science and Computational Intelligence (DaSCI)](https://dasci.es/) research group from the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/).
